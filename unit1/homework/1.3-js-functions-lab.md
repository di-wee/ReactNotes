# JavaScript Functions Lab

## Introduction

This lab provides an opportunity to practice defining and coding some real-world functions.

> **Note:** Feel free to work in pairs to complete this lab. Also, Google/StackOverflow is a good friend to have around...

## Exercise

#### Setup & Instructions

On your computer, create a directory in `sei-sg-##-homework/u1/1.3-functions-lab` with your name. e.g. `sei-sg-XX-homework/u1/1.3-functions-lab/<your_name>`.

Create a file called **index.js** and do your homework in this file.

Copy the exercises below into **index.js** file and code away!

This lab is **a DELIVERABLE**.

#### Requirements

Define and code the functions below.

Define the functions using the approach as specified (either as a function expression or declaration).

Be sure to number each function with a comment above it.

After each function, call it **at least once** and `console.log` the results.

For example, here's the first function, our gift to you:

```js
// 1.
function maxOfTwoNumbers(x, y) {
  if (x >= y) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return y;
  }
  
  // or more "elegantly" using the fantastic ternary expression!
  // return  x >= y ? x : y;
}

console.log(maxOfTwoNumbers(3, 9));

// 2.
...
```

Here are the functions:

1. (_completed above_) Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If they are the same, return that number. Use the if-else construct or a [ternary expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) -  the Math.max method is not allowed.

2. Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Again, the Math.max method is not allowed.

3. Define a function `isCharAVowel` that takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

4. Define a function `sumArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, `sumArray([2, 4, 5]);` would return `11`.

5. Define a function `multiplyArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns the product those numbers. For example, `multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]);` would return `40`.

6. Define a function `numArgs` that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.

7. Define a function `reverseString` that takes a string, reverses the characters, and returns it. For example, `reverseString('rockstar');` would return the string "ratskcor".

8. Define a function `longestStringInArray` that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns the length of the longest string.

9. Define a function `stringsLongerThan` that takes an array of strings and a number as arguments; and returns an array of the strings that are longer than the number passed in. For example, `stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 3);` would return `["hello", "morning"]`.
