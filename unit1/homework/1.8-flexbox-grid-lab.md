- Choose either the vertical or horizontal "profile card" above to reproduce using HTML and CSS.

- Use a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid to layout the individual elements as close as possible - it does not have to be perfect!

## Setup

1. Create a folder with your name in the unit's repo i.e., `sei-sg-##-homework/u1/1.7-flexbox-grid-lab/<your_name>`
2. Set up HTMl and CSS files. Link the CSS file to the HTML file.
3. Code away!

## Hints

- Be sure to start with a bit of CSS reset:

  ```css
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Helvetica;
  }
  ```

- Colors to use: 
- - Phone Background: RGB(130, 207, 143); 
- - Chat Background: RGB(116, 187, 130); 
- - Profile Pic Outline: RGB(138, 209, 150); 
- - Grey Background: RGB(243, 243, 243);

- Elements can be made to appear circular by using `border-radius: 50%;`.

- For the rating scale with the stars, feel free to use this image tag:

	```html

- You can ignore the "phone" & "conversation" icons, just set the background colors of the "box".

## Bonus

As a bonus:
- reproduce both the vertical and horizontal versions!
