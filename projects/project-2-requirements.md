# Project 2: React Application

## Overview

This second project will be your first adventure into **building a full-stack
application.** You'll be **building a React app** from the ground up yourself.

This is exciting and by the end of this unit we will have given you the all of the tools needed to build your app.

You get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

**You will be working individually for this project.** You'll be designing and coding the app yourself.

Additionally as part of the project's requirements, you'll be required to take and pass a Project Assessment.

## Planning & Presentation Requirements

### Planning - Due by ________

- A **[Trello](https://trello.com/) board** with:

    ☐ **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following
      three lists in your board:<br>
       - **Ice Box**<br>
       - **Current/MVP**<br>
       - **Completed**<br>
      <br>**User Stories** must follow the following template:<br>**_As a \<user role\>, I want \<feature\>, because \<reason\>._**<br>The _reason_ is optional if it's blatantly obvious.
      <br><br>Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish
      list" stories at the bottom.
      <br><br>Then move the stories that make up the MVP to the Current/MVP list (in the order that you want to implement them) leaving behind the "real" optional/ice box features.
      <br><br>When all of the completed stories have been moved to the Completed list, move the highest-priority Ice Box story to the Current/MVP list and implement it, etc.

    ☐ A **Wireframes** list containing wireframes for the app's main pages of functionality, e.g. Landing Page, Posts Index Page, Favorite Posts Page, Add Post Page, etc.

### Project Presentations - __________

You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

1. **Introduce the Project:**

 ☐ Intro your project by paraphrasing the README.

2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

 ☐ Launch the deployed app by clicking the link in the README.

 ☐ Demonstrate the features of the app.

1. **Show/discuss your code:**

 ☐ Show what the API returns

 ☐ Show your favorite API call

 ☐ Show the Component for the routing

1. **Share the experience:**

 ☐ What was your biggest challenge?

 ☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?

5. **Q & A + Feedback**

## Technical Requirements

### Your App Must

☐ **Use 3rd party API and/or Airtable**

- Calling an API and displaying the data for the user. You may use any API of your choosing or [Find an available API here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- You may also opt to use Airtable if you need to store data.

☐ **Use React framework** to build your application with *at least*

- 3 components
- 4 props
- 1 lifting state
- 2 states
- 2 setState
- 2 routes

☐ Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, **it should have a consistent and polished user interface.**

☐ Be **deployed online** (Vercel).

### Optionally, Your App May

☐ Have **full-CRUD data operations** somewhere within the app's features. For example, you can have functionality that **C**reates & **U**pdates a _post_ and satisfy **D**elete functionality by implementing the ability to delete _comments_.

☐ - Use more than 1 API

☐ - Use a React component library like [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

---

## Necessary Deliverables

☐ **A working react app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on Vercel**.

- **A ``README.md`` file** with these sections (here's a [basic template](project-readme-starter.md)):

  ☐ **App Title:** Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.
  
  ☐ **Screenshot(s):** A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.
  
  ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.

  ☐ **Getting Started**: Include a link to the deployed app and your Trello board with the project's planning.
  
  ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
  
  > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ **Daily commits (the more the better) dating back to the very beginning of the project**. Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style landing page" instead of "Styled landing page". **Do not "start over" with a new repo.**

## Getting Started

- **Discuss your app idea with an instructor to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes.**
- Because your app's functionality revolves around the API, **implement routes and basic fetching first!**
- **Prioritize and implement the user stories one at a time** by following the [Guide to Add a Feature to a Web App](guide-to-add-feature-to-web-app.md).
- **Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP** – feature creep can doom a project!

---

## Project Idea Guidance

- Think of a problem in your daily life that could be potentially be solved with technology or an app. Distill the problem down to the simplest case and design an React MVP that can solve a simple version of it.
- **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application.** It's tempting to just make them to-do lists for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will endeavor to deliver your code review to you ASAP following presentations.
- If your instructors determine that your project would pass with minor fixes, you will be required to address the minor deficiencies by 9 am the following day. Please be sure to inform your local instructor when the fixes are complete. FYI, "minor fixes" are minor items that can be fixed very quickly, like code formatting, correcting the README, etc.
- If your instructors determine that the project does not meet the minimum requirements you may request to address the deficiencies identified and resubmit the project. However, be aware that **there is only a single opportunity to resubmit a project or project assessment during the course**.
- Immediately after your presentation, your instructor and/or outcomes may provide you with feedback that will benefit your project and perhaps the projects of other students as well.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback, please ask!
