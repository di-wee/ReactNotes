# Mongoose "Flights" Lab - Part 1

## Intro

You'll begin by creating a `mongoose-flights` project.

#### The final version of `mongoose-flights` (parts 1 thru 3 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.

## Exercises

1. Use express generator to create a `mongoose-flights` project. Be sure to install the Node modules after you `cd` into the project.

2. Install the `dotenv` module and

```js
// server.js

const logger = require('morgan');
// Add the line below
require('dotenv').config();
```

3. Create a **.env** file in the root of the project file.

4. Create your `DATABASE_URL=...` in the **.env** file.

5. Create a **config/database.js** module that connects to a database.

6. Be sure to require the **config/database.js** AFTER `dotenv` in **server.js**.

7. Verify that starting the Express server with `nodemon` console.logs out a successful connection to the database.

8. Create a `Flight` Model with the following properties:

| Property | Type  | Validations | Default Value |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| `airline`   | `String` | `enum` to include 'American', 'Southwest' & 'United'<br>(or your choices) | n/a | 
| `airport`| `String`| `enum` to include<br>'AUS', 'DFW', 'DEN', 'LAX' & 'SAN'<br>(or your choices) | 'DEN'<br>(or your choice) |
| `flightNo`| `Number`| Required<br>Between `10` and `9999` | n/a | 
| `departs`| `Date`| n/a | One year from date created | 

9. Implement the following User Stories:
- I want to view a list of all flights that displays each flight's airline, airport, flight no., and departure date/time (consider formatting the `departs` property).
- I want to create flights by submitting a JSON body.
- I want to be able to access each data via a url (i.e. using parameters or queries) to:
	- `ALL FLIGHTS`

## Bonuses

1. Code these additional User Stories:
	- I want to view the list of flights by departure date in ascending order.	
	- I want the flights in the list to be displayed with a * if the flight's departure date has passed.


## Deliverable?

### The final version of `mongoose-flights` (parts 1 thru 3 combined) will be a deliverable - don't fall behind.
