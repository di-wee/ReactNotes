# Express Practice/Lab 
---

## Intro

The Intro to Express lesson, with all of that new information, can be mind-blowing for sure.

It's natural, in fact, **expected**, to feel "uncomfortable" and confused by Node.js & Express at this point.

As always, the journey toward competence requires practice - so let's get on with it!

### This Lab is a Deliverable

## Exercise

The goal of the exercise is to do everything that you did during the Into to Express lesson!

Create an express app with endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. What the express app does is up to you.

## Bonus

This is an advanced bonus that previews what we will soon learn in class...

Create a route and view dedicated to displaying a single data resource, for example, a single student.

The key to implementing this feature is **route parameters** documented in the **Route parameters** section of the [Express Routing guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html).

Basically, you can define a route as follows:

```js
app.get('/students/:id', function(req, res) {
  console.log(`The value for the :id route parameter is: ${req.params.id}`);
  res.render('students/show', {student: studentDb.getOne(req.params.id)});
});
```
