# Mongoose "Flights" Lab - Part 2

## Intro

In this lab you'll be adding functionality to the `mongoose-flights` project you created in the _part 1_ lab.

#### The final version of `mongoose-flights` will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to add the ability to specify an array of `destinations` for the flight - if the flight is non-stop, then there will be only one destination sub-doc in the array.

## Exercises

1. Create a `destinationSchema` that will provide the structure for _destination_ subdocuments with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Validations | Default Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `airport`| `String`| `enum` to include<br>'AUS', 'DFW', 'DEN', 'LAX' & 'SAN'<br>(your choice) | n/a |
| `arrival`| `Date`| n/a | n/a | 

2. Add the following property to the `Flight` Model:

| Property | Type | Validations | Default Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `destinations`| `[destinationSchema]`| n/a | n/a | 

3. Implement the following User Story:<br>_I want to submit a flight info and view all of the properties for that flight._

4. Implement the following User Story:<br>_I want to be able to add a destination for a flight, including its `arrival` date/time & one of the established airport codes_

5. Implement the following User Story:<br>_I want to see a list of that flight's `destinations` (`airport` & `arrival`)_


## Bonus

Sort the list of `destinations` for a flight by the `arrival` date/time in ascending order.

## Deliverable?

### The final version of `mongoose-flights` will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.
