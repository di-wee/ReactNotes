# Mongoose "Flights" Lab - Part 3

## Intro

In this lab you'll be adding functionality to the `mongoose-flights` project you created in _part 1_ and have continued to work on in _part 2_ of the lab.

#### The final version of `mongoose-flights`, as a result of completing parts 1 - 3 of this lab, is a DELIVERABLE.

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to practice referencing related data.

You will add the ability to create _tickets_ for a given _flight_ in the `mongoose-flight` project.

The relationship between the data entities is:<br>
`Flight --< Ticket`<br>
_A flight has many tickets_ / _A ticket belongs to a flight_

## Exercises

1. Create a `ticketSchema` that will be compiled into a `Ticket` Model with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Validations | Default Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seat`| `String`| Must be 'A1' thru 'F99' (see hints) | n/a |
| `price`| `Number`| Minimum of `0` | n/a |
| `flight`| `ObjectId`| Include `ref: 'Flight'` to enable population | n/a |

##### Hints

Notice how we don't _have_ to use an array to implement the 1:M relationship between `Flight` and `Ticket`. Instead, referencing the `ObjectId` of the _flight_ in the `flight` property of a _ticket_ enables the relationship. FYI, to implement this 1:M relationship, we _could_ have put a `tickets` array on the `Flight` model instead. Yup, unlike M:M relationships, 1:M doesn't require the use of an array property - just an ObjectId on the "belongs to" side (child side) of the relationship.

Define the `seat` property as follows:<br>`seat: {type: String, match: /[A-F][1-9]\d?/}` - that's what we call a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) that's being assigned to the `match` validator. Now for the best part, which just might blow your mind! You ready?  Here it is... HTML `<input>` tags have a `pattern` attribute that accept a regex pattern; and if what's typed in the `<input>` doesn't match the pattern, the form can't be submitted! Here's what your `<input>` should look like for entering the seat:

```html
<input name="seat" required pattern="[A-F][1-9]\d?">
```
That regex pattern will match the following characters:

- An `A` thru `F` character, followed by
- a `1` thru `9` character, followed by
- zero or one `0` thru `9` character.

We'll cover more about regular expressions soon enough in SEI, but this opportunity to preview them was too hard to pass up! Combined with the HTML `pattern` attribute, they provide an excellent way to perform _client-side_ validation of inputs.

2. Implement the following user story:<br>_I want to view a list of the tickets that have been created for that flight_

##### Hints

To show a list of _tickets_ that belong to a _flight_.  This is going to require the controller to make a separate query (inside of the callback of the `Flight.findById` call) to retrieve the tickets as follows:

```js
Flight.findById(req.params.id, function(err, flight) {
    Ticket.find({flight: flight._id}, function(err, tickets) {
         // Now you can pass both the flight and tickets in the res.render call
        ...
    });
});
```

 Note that there's no reason to `populate` the `flight` property because in this case, you already have obtained the _flight_ using `Flight.findById`.

For future reference though, here's how to populate a _ticket's_ `flight` property:

```js
Ticket.findById(req.params.id)
  .populate('flight')
  .exec(function(err, ticket) {...
```

3. Also add an endpoint to create a _ticket_ for the _flight_. When the data is submitted, create the _ticket_ on the server.

## Bonuses

Add a endpoint to delete a flight's _ticket_.

## Deliverable?

### The final version of `mongoose-flights`, as a result of completing parts 1 - 3 of this lab, is a DELIVERABLE.
