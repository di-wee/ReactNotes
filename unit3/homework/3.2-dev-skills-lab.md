# Express Lab
# My Dev Skills

## Intro

You've now seen how we can generate a skeleton Express application and implement RESTful endpoints.

Now it's time to practice by doing the very same thing, but for a different data resource - _developer skills_.

##### This lab is a Deliverable

## Exercises

The goal of the lab is to use everything that you did during the _Express - Routers & Controllers_ lesson:

- Be sure to create an array of "fake" data representing some of your awesome developer skills. The specific properties describing a skill object is up to you! 

## Hints

- Keep the data resource name short and simple - something like `skills`.

- Following best-practice routing and MVC will result in the following modules for the `skills` resource:
	- **routes/skills.js**
	- **models/skill.js**
	- **controllers/skills.js**

#### RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping

HTTP Method<br>(Verb) | Path/Endpoint/URI  | CRUD Operation | Typical<br>Controller Action | Has Data<br>Payload
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
GET     | /skills          | Read all _skills_ | index | No
GET     | /skills/:id      | Read a specific _skill_ | show | No
POST    | /skills          | Create a new _skill_ | create | Yes
PUT     | /skills/:id      | Update specified _skill_  | update | Yes
DELETE  | /skills/:id      | Delete specified _skill_ | delete | No

## Bonus

- Implement validation

- Implement `One:Many` and `Many:Many` Relationships below
#### Routing for Related Resources (One:Many & Many:Many Relationships)

HTTP Method<br>(Verb) | Path/Endpoint/URI  | CRUD Operation<br>or Purpose | Note
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:
GET     | /skills/:id/levels | Read all _levels_ for a _skill_ | No payload
GET     | /levels/:id | Read one _level_ for a _skill_ | "Shallow" route / No payload
POST     | /skills/:id/levels | Create a _level_ for a _skill_ (1:M) | Needs Payload
PUT     | /levels/:id      | Update specified _level_  | "Shallow" route / Needs payload
DELETE  | /levels/:id      | Delete specified _level_ | "Shallow" route / No payload
POST     | /skills/:skillId/blogs/:blogId | Associate a _skill_ with a _blog_ (M:M) | No payload
POST     | /skills/:skillId/blogs | Associate a _skill_ with a _blog_ (M:M) | id of blog included in payload vs endpoint

> Most apps have data resources related to the logged in user.  However, in regards to routing, DO NOT treat these data resources as nested resources.  The server will already know who the logged in user is, therefore you will never need to, nor should you, provide the id of the logged in user, for example, never have a route such as `POST /users/:id/posts`.  Instead, a route of `POST /posts` is sufficient for creating a post for the logged in user.  This being the case, if for some reason your app's functionality calls for **reading** a paricular user's data that is not the logged in user, then yes, a route such as `GET /users/:id/profile` would be okay.
